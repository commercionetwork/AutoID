# AutoID

AutoID is the first multi-chain, easy-to-use and multiplatform Cosmos Hub wallet. Entirely made with Flutter, it fetches the data about the supported chains from a remote source. This means that adding a new supported chain is no harder than submitting a PR to the proper GitHub repository ðŸ˜‰.

This project was born from an International team entry at the WANXIANG Hackaton Shanghai 2019
